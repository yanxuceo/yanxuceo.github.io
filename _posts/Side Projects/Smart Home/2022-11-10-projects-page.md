# Smart Kitchen device - VoiScale
Do you keep a daily log of what you eat and how much you eat each day? Are you tracking progress toward your nutrition, fitness, weight loss and water goals? If that's yes, then how?

Get food weight - pick up your phone - open the app - select object - check its calorie - etc. BUT all of these operations can be done by just telling Alexa, what it is you are going to eat or drink! 

Goal: <br />
It's all about releasing your hands and saving your time!

With my VoiScale: <br />
"Alexa, open Smart Scale to record my diet"
"It's a Banana", 
"Brocollie", 
"Huhu, I get Chicken Chest"
"I've got Whey Protein" 

"Alexa, show my history data in the past week"
"Alexa, recommend me a recipe"

Tell and go! That's it! Then food weight is recorded, nutrition facts are displayed on your screen, such as Echo Show. Later on, you can review your daily log, set your goal, track your progress all by speaking to Alexa.
