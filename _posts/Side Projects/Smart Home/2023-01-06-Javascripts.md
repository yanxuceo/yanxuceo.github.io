<span style="color:#3ababa">Promises</span> are objects that represent the not-yet-available result of an asynchronous operation. The keywords <span style="color:#3ababa">async</span> and <span style="color:#3ababa">await</span> simplify asynchronous programming by allowing you to structure your Promise-based code as if it was synchronous. Finally, the <span style="color:#3ababa">for/await</span> loop allow you to work with streams of asynchronous events using simple loops that appear synchronous.


## 1. Asynchronous Progamming with Callbacks
A callback is a function that you write and then pass to some other function. That other function then invokes your function when some condition is met or some synchronous event occurs.
### Timers
```
setTimeout(checkForUpdates, 60000);
```

### Events
Client-side JavaScript programs are almost universally event driven: rather than running some kind of predetermined computation, they
typically wait for the user to do something and then respond to the userâ€™s actions.

```
let okay = document.querySelector('#confirmUpdateDialogbutton.okay');

// Now register a callback function to be invoked when the user clicks on that button.
okay.addEventListener('click', applyUpdate);
```

### Network Events
Another common source of asynchrony in JavaScript programming is network requests.

getCurrentVersionNumber() makes an asynchronous request, it cannot synchronously return the value that the caller is interested in. Instead, the caller passes a callback function, which is invoked when the result is ready or when an error occurs.

### Callbacks and Events in Node
Node.js asynchronous example: reading the contents of a file. fs.readFile() takes a two-parameter callback as its last argument.
