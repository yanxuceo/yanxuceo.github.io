Some thoughts on Life Attitude/What Other People Think, from a friend <br />
做自己想做的任何事, 不用在意别人的看法

Changed a bit from the original:
> I didn't go to some activities with my girlfriend/boyfriend and I didn't want to meet her/his friends because I thought I had to get a better job/lose some weight/grow more muscles, etc. first. Turned out that this way of thinking isolated me and held me back from living life to the fullest/experiencing new things etc. I mean it took me a while to understand that I see myself very differently than other people see me. People don't give a shit if you earn 5K euro more/6 packs/weight 6kg too much. So I started to not give a shit about what other people think. I simply don't care anymore, because it's my life, my body and I have to be happy the way I am. It simply doesn't matter if others think I'm good enough or not. Most of them are NPCs and everyone is the main character in their own life.
