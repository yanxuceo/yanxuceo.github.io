# Chapter 3 Char Drivers
Char drivers, block drivers, network drivers, the goal of this part is to understand and write a complete char device driver. The first step of driver writing is defining the capabilities the driver will offer to user programs.

## 1. Data structures
Most of the fundamental driver operations involve three important kernel structures, called __file_operations__, __file__, and __inode__. We'll take a quick look at each of them.


### File Operations
We have some device numbers for our use, _file_operations_ would connect any of our driver's operations to those numbers. Each open file, represented by a file structure, is associated with its own set of functions(_f_op_ pointing to a _file_operations_ structure). These operations are mostly in charge of implementing the system calls and are therefore, named _open_, _read_, and so on.

Book example for _scull_ device driver:
```
struct file_operations scull_fops = {
    .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    .llseek = scull_llseek,
    .read = scull_read,
    .write = scull_write,
    .ioctl = scull_ioctl,
    .open = scull_open,
    .release = scull_release,
};
```

### File structure
A _struct file_ is a kernel structure that never appears in user programs. The _file_ structure represents an _open file_. It is created by the kernel on _open_ and is passed to any function that operates on the file, until the last close. Notice, in the kernel sources, _file_ refers to the structure and _filp_ to a pointer to the structure.

### inode structure
The _inode_ structure is used by the kernel internally to represent files. Thus it is different from the _file_ structure that represents an open file discriptor. There can be multiple _file_ structures representing multiple open descriptors on a single file, but they all point to a single _inode_ structure. As illustrated in this figure, cited from [here](https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/courses/IC221/classes/L09/Class.html), we will come back to this topic later when it comes to Unix File Systems design.

The _inode_ structure contains a great deal of information about the file. Only two fields of this structure are of concerns for writing driver code:
* dev_t i_rdev; <br />
For inode that represents device files, this field contains the actual device number.
* struct cdev *i_cdev; <br />
struct cdev represents char devices in kernel. 


## 2. Char Device Registration
Before the kernel invokes your device's operations, you must allocate and register one or more of these structures. <br />
1. To obtain a standalone _cdev structure_ at runtime, we can do this:
```
struct cdev *my_cdev = cdev_alloc( );
my_cdev->ops = &my_fops;
```

2. If in a case that you want to embed the _cdev structure_ within a device-specific structure of your own, you can use:
```
void cdev_init(struct cdev *cdev, struct file_operations *fops);
int cdev_add(struct cdev *dev, dev_t num, unsigned int count);
```
