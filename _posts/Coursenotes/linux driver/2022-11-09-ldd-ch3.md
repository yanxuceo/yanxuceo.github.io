# Chapter 3 Char Drivers
Char drivers, block drivers, network drivers, the goal of this part is to understand and write a complete char device driver. The first step of driver writing is defining the capabilities the driver will offer to user programs.

## Data structures
Most of the fundamental driver operations involve three important kernel structures, called _file_operations_, _file_, and _inode_. We'll take a quick look at each of them.


### File Operations
We have some device numbers for our use, _file_operations_ would connect any of our driver's operations to those numbers. Each open file, represented by a file structure, is associated with its own set of functions(_f_op_ pointing to a _file_operations_ structure). These operations are mostly in charge of implementing the system calls and are therefore, named _open_, _read_, and so on.
