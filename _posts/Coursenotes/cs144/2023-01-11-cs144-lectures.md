<span style="color:#3ababa">Problem</span>: Applications send and receive data in packets over an Internet that is unreliable. <br />
<span style="color:#3ababa">Goal</span>: Sending data reliably over an Internet that is unreliable.

In summary:<br />
Packets are forwarded hop-by-hop using the IP destination address. Our applications use TCP to make sure they are delivered and put back in the correct order.

<span style="color:#FF7433">Reliability</span> <br />
A module behaves reliably when it:
- provides some stated abstraction/interface
- even in the face of underlying faults(e.g. packet loss)
- and when it can't do that, the module signals failure

Question: <br />
How to provide these abstractions reliably on top of an unreliable system?
